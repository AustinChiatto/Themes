# `BMO Noire` *by* `forevertuesday`

A BMO inspired theme that recreates the character's face and desktop as seen in the animated series Adventure Time (Season 5, Episode 28: "Be More").
This grayscale version of the theme draws inspiration from BMO's adventure as a detective on the case of Finn's missing sock (Season 4, Episode 7: "BMO Noire").
Unfortunately, this theme does not support Recents nor Expert menu items and BMO will let you know if you try to enable these options.

Additional boot audio files are included should you find the one installed to be too long. To change the boot audio option, you will need to rename the "bgm (short).mp3" or "bgm (medium).mp3" file to "bgm.mp3" and drag it into the sound folder.

## Special Thanks

A huge thank you to tenlevels for their incredible support in putting this theme together. I couldn't have done this without them.
I had a vision for this theme but I had no idea how to make it actually work. Tenlevels graciously offered to help out and made the theme functional.
Tenlevels also edited the font and added the ability to allow for many different language options.
Tenlevels also added the audio "Who wants to play video games" when the device boots up which was absolutely mathematical!
Lastly, thanks to Gumpy Function (https://gumpyfunction.itch.io/virtual-bmo) for creating their GameBoy game. I was inspired to do this theme after seeing this game!
