# `BMO` *by* `forevertuesday`

A BMO inspired theme that recreates the character's face and desktop as seen in the animated series Adventure Time (Season 5, Episode 28: "Be More"). 
Unfortunately, this theme does not support Recents nor Expert menu items and BMO will let you know if you try to enable these options.


## Credits

**Icons:** Most icons are recreations and modified versions of icons found at Streamline (https://www.streamlinehq.com/icons/pixels). 
A few icons are forevertuesday's work heavily inspired by Susan Kare's Macintosh icons.

**Console icons:** From [Art Book Next by anthonycaccese] (https://github.com/anthonycaccese) [edited to fit by tenlevels for this theme]

**Boot audio** From Adventure Time episode "Rainy Day Daydream" (Season 1, Episode 23)

## Special Thanks

A huge thank you to tenlevels for their incredible support in putting this theme together. 
I had a vision for this theme but I had no idea how to make it actually work. Tenlevels graciously offered to help out and made the theme functional.
Tenlevels also edited the font and added the ability to allow for many different language options.
Tenlevels also added the audio "Who wants to play video games" when the device boots up which was absolutely mathematical!
Lastly, thanks to Gumpy Function (https://gumpyfunction.itch.io/virtual-bmo) for creating their GameBoy game. I was inspired to do this theme after seeing this game!
