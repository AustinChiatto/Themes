First of all big thanks to all of the OnionOS devs! Special thanks to Aemiii91 for making the Blueprint Theme and Schmurtz for the Easy Logotweak App!

INSTRUCTIONS

Boot Logo:

In order to install the Boot Logo (which is different from the 'bootScreen.png') install EasyLogoTweak by Schmurtz from https://github.com/schmurtzm/Miyoo-Mini-easy-logotweak and copy the folder inside the 'Boot Logo' folder to \App\EasyLogoTweak\logos. 

Drastic (Nintendo DS) Icon:

Copy 'icon.png' from the 'Drastic Icon' folder to \Emu\drastic\. (Also included in the 'icons' folder as nds.png, hopefuly this future proofs it for when Drastic gets integrated into OnionOS.)

Alternative files:

I've decided to make 'ONION' the default because the OnionOS devs have done so much for us but if you prefer it to say 'MIYOO' instead, copy the 'miyoo-topbar.png' and the 'extras' folder inside the 'Alt Miyoo Version' folder to the 'skin' folder.

If your Miyoo has RGBY buttons and you would like the 'B' button to be yellow instead of red, copy the file from the 'Alt Yellow B Button' folder to the 'skin' folder. If you end up not liking that, replace it with the file from the  'Alt Red B Button' folder.

Background music:

Let's do the Mario!, Super Mario Bros. Super Show Intro

If you get annoyed by the bg music and I wouldn't blame you, go to the 'sound' folder and delete (OR RENAME - you might regret you decision after all) the file called bgm.mp3. Or replace it with your own tunes!
