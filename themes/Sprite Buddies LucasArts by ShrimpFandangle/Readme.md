First of all big thanks to all of the OnionOS devs! Special thanks to Aemiii91 for making the Blueprint Theme and Schmurtz for the Easy Logotweak App!

INSTRUCTIONS

Boot Logo:

In order to install the Boot Logo (which is different from the 'bootScreen.png') install EasyLogoTweak by Schmurtz from https://github.com/schmurtzm/Miyoo-Mini-easy-logotweak and copy the folder inside the 'Boot Logo' folder to \App\EasyLogoTweak\logos. 

Drastic (Nintendo DS) Icon:

Copy 'icon.png' from the 'Drastic Icon' folder to \Emu\drastic\. (Also included in the 'icons' folder as nds.png, hopefuly this future proofs it for when Drastic gets integrated into OnionOS.)

Background music:

The Scumm Bar (MI1) Bone Wagon (GF), Pleasently Understated Credit Sequence (S&M) and several others

If you get annoyed by the bg music and I wouldn't blame you, go to the 'sound' folder and delete (OR RENAME - you might regret you decision after all) the file called bgm.mp3. Or replace it with your own tunes!
