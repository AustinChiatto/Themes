# Contributing

We welcome you to share your creation with the community, here's a checklist for contributing:

## Checklist

1. Background music must be 48kHz mp3 format or it will be played too fast.  
2. Please test and make sure it's the final version, before submitting.
3. It has a 480x360 preview (take a 640x480 screenshot by pressing <kbd>MENU</kbd>+<kbd>POWER</kbd> - then resize it).
4. In the config file, the name and author are separated.  `"name": "Silky",  "author": "DiMo", ...`
5. The zip file should be named `[NAME] by [AUTHOR].zip` and either contain a single folder with the same name or the config at the root.

Download and check out one of the themes in the [Theme Repository](https://github.com/OnionUI/Themes/blob/main/README.md) if you're in doubt.

Submit your theme by sending it to Aemiii91 via [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/Aemiii91) or [Discord](https://discordapp.com/users/474330900151402497).
