# Contributing

We welcome you to share your creation with the community, but first some rules for contributing:

## Rules

1. Themes will be removed if we receive a takedown request from copyright holders.
2. Background music must be 48kHz mp3 format or it will be played too fast.  
3. Please test and make sure it's the final version, before submitting.
4. Submit your theme by sending it to [Sichroteph](https://www.reddit.com/user/OnionUI) via Reddit.

## Tips and Tools

You can find some resources on creating custom themes in [the Onion wiki](https://github.com/OnionUI/Onion/wiki/4.-Custom-Themes).
