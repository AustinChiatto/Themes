# Contributing

We welcome you to share your creation with the community, but first some checkpoints for contributing:

## Checkpoints

1. Themes will be removed if we receive a takedown request from copyright holders.
2. Background music must be 48kHz mp3 format or it will be played too fast.  
3. Please test and make sure it's the final version, before submitting.
4. It has a 480x360 preview.
5. In the config file, the name and author are separated. 
6. The zip file should be named [NAME] by [AUTHOR].zip and either contain a single folder with the same name or the config at the root.

Check a theme from this page if you have a doubt :
