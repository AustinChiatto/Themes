## How to install

- Make sure you're on at least Onion v3.9+.
- Extract the downloaded theme to the `Themes` folder on your SD card.
- Apply the theme using the on-device **Themes** app.
- Alternatively, you can leave the themes zipped if you want faster transfers.
  - The **Themes** app will automatically unpack these once you apply them.
- **Note on standalone icon packs:** same procedure, just extract them to the `Icons` folder instead.
  - Then you can change the active icon pack in **Apps › Tweaks › Appearance › Icon packs**.
